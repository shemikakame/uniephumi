В результате в меню «Пуск» появится раздел Microsoft DirectX SDK (SDK June 2010). Здесь содержаться ярлыки для всех нужных программ. So my brothers had a bunch of old PCs lying around, I decided to take what I could and make a PC for them, it should theoretically be able to play older games fine but it is acting pretty slow, I dont know the technical parts of PC building, only putting it together. Right now it can turn on and run some games, but even old ones stutter every now and then and being on the desktop feels slow and unresponsive. I would love for someone to help find the cause. Here is the report for it. CPU-Z. DirectX SDK - набор инструментов, утилит и документации для разработки программного обеспечения на основе DirectX. About me: I'm a beginner in ROCm / HCC programming. But I've collected a bunch of reading material to help myself get started. It looks like an exciting set of technology from AMD. What is ROCm / HCC? ================= ROCm / HCC is AMD's Single-source C++ framework for GPGPU programming. In effect: HCC is a CLang based compiler, which compiles your code in two passes. It compiles a x86 version of your code, AND a GPU version of your code. Because the same compiler processes DirectX SDK June 2010, RU. Download the complete DirectX SDK, which contains the DirectX Runtime and all DirectX software required to create DirectX compliant applications. I used an old drive with files and among those files were Avast 4.7 (really old, maybe 2011 ish?) today I woke up to this ( I did not install anything prior to this except from Microsoft DirectX SDK June 2010, Google Protobuf & Visual Studio 2017 None of these offer Avast in their installer I also have a problem where I can't exit / close Avast: ( I can't close it from task manager.

I got 1.4.1 working on my Mac. Basically, I downloaded the magnet full version of 1.4.1, then copied and pasted it into u/Supercommodore's AM2R 1.1 Mac version previously posted, then changed the videomemorysize with Winetricks, then reinstalled an updated directx and anything having to do with Direct 3d (d3d\ \ ).

EDIT 2: Okay, after playing for a while and reconfiguring the graphics settings, I found something curious: I set up the graphics configuration to "Full Screen" and 1920 1080 resolution (my screen). Other graphic options were set to the default "Standard (Laptop)". With this set, after I logged out, the game crashed causing 3 or 4 windows like the one in the problem to appear (with different .exe files crashing). Due to fear of having to reinstall the game again, I immediately tried

Пошаговое видео руководство о том, как подключить DirectX SDK к Visual Studio. I used to play this game on a GTX 680 2GB, and needless to say knowing this game, my performance was horrible, even if i could run most next gen on high-ultra still. Now i upgraded to an overclocked GTX 1080. My framerate in crowded republic fleet is 30fps. In one of the lvl 65 flashpoints, like a jungle arena or something, in the middle boss fight my fps went to 15fps. I play healer, running between those kolto tanks and healing people at 15fps is no joke. Is this for real? Is there something. Именно это и привело к тому, что новая операционная система Windows 10 получила обновление в виде Directx. I've actually worked out the issues that made the other wrapper that I uploaded not work. I think. Comment if you experience any problems, but I can't guarantee an answer.

Have not tested with other versions yet. How to create a portable version Hi guys, Some of you may remember I posted a thread a little while back asking how to go about how to download and compile the source code (https://www.reddit.com/r/HaloOnline/comments/42folg/source_code_help_workflow/). The thread garnered a lot of interest so I thought I would write what I learned about the process.

I was hoping someone would be able to help me out. I recently purchased a Surface Book i7 / dGPU / 16GB / 512GB SSD, and have been enjoying it so far. However, when trying to play most DirectX 11 games, along with running Epic Games Launcher, I keep running into issues with black screens for every game involved. Thinking this was a DirectX 11 issue, I installed the DirectX SDK from June 2010, but this has not resolved the issues. Any help would be most appreciated in this manner. Hi. I am the lead developer for Brutal Nature ( and I am looking for a 3D shader programmer to help bring my game engines graphics into the 21st century. (See website for free download of game and screenshots) I need the following things added to my custom 3d engine written in C++, targeting windows and DX11 (PS4.0 through PS5.0, degraded effects in PS4.0 is acceptable) 1: Real time mesh decimation of the terrain. The world is a user editable voxel world so every. My brother just got this game and he tries to launch it and it says Unsupported version of directx etc etc He has DX11 but his DDI in dxdiag shows 10.1 any way around this ? Also for some reason dxcpl isnt an option? Apparently it isnt on his computer even though he just re-downloaded sdk june 2010, He us using a laptop with a mobility radeon 4650 anyone In all honesty, I have no idea how to tile this thread. I've been trying to find a solution to this for awhile. Have tried messing with my DCOM settings and a few other things, but this is STILL happening. I'd assume it's an issue with my GFX card, but I honestly have no idea. If this ends up being in the wrong section, I apologize. Just no idea where to post this. SO. What's happening? Basically, when I play certain games, both my monitors kinda of go "staticy" I know that won't make sense. I've been trying to learn Directx recently and started to read "Introduction to 3D Game Programming With DirectX 11" by Frank Luna. The book was being pretty interesting until I've encountered problems that I couldn't solve by my own. One of the first steps of the book is to compile one program that Frank Luna wrote, which is a Box drawn in DirectX, since the code he wrote in the book uses the Microsoft DirectX SDK(June 2010) I had to install it too, because apparently DirectX is now included. My computer keeps crashing when playing. especially after a new match starts. these are my comp's specs: Processor Information: Vendor: AuthenticAMD CPU Family: 0x15 CPU Model: 0x2 CPU Stepping: 0x0 CPU Type: 0x0 Speed: 3515 Mhz 8 logical processors 4 physical processors HyperThreading: Supported FCMOV: Supported SSE2: Supported SSE3: Supported SSSE3: Supported SSE4a: Supported SSE41: Supported SSE42: Supported. 
So, the goggles have done nothing; I beseech thee. I recently downloaded iRO via Steam after a fresh install of Windows 8.1 x86 (64bit) and while I can get the game to run, I've been having problems with loading screens freezing and lag. My system is pretty decent, though both of my hard-drives are old (one from '07, and one from '05) though they still hold data perfectly; nothing seems to be corrupt. I've tried to run the game as an admin, and through compatibility mode (Vista Processor Information: Vendor: GenuineIntel CPU Family: 0x6 CPU Model: 0x3a CPU Stepping: 0x9 CPU Type: 0x0 Speed: 2594 Mhz 4 logical processors 2 physical processors HyperThreading: Supported FCMOV: Supported SSE2: Supported SSE3: Supported SSSE3: Supported SSE4a: Unsupported SSE41: Supported SSE42: Supported Network Information: Network Speed: Operating System Version: Windows Hey all! My thread prolly will be lost in all these Worlds topic but its worth a try. I'd like to ask a question, would be great if anyone could help me out with it. I have used as far as i remember Windows 7 Home Edition, everything went fine untill i switched to 64 bit windows 7 ultimate (before everything i am not blaming w7 64b but i just dk what could be the problem is). So i experienced since then that my fps is dramatically dropping from 60-65 fps to 2-13-15-20 in team fights, which. A while back, I was advised to get Frank Luna's 3D Game Programming with DirectX 11. It was supposed to be a great introduction to DirectX given my background (lots of C++ and some basic graphics knowledge). So I bought it, and it sat on my shelf for a few months while I worked on school projects. I recently pulled it down, read through the intro, and tried to set up the sample program. Of course, it failed spectacularly because I was using VS 2012 instead of 2010 like it said to. Good thing. I have an Acer Travelmate P645-MG and for some bizarre reason when I loaded up FFXIV, I get massvie flickering. Like, epilepsy-inducing. I have the latest AMD drivers (HD 8750M is in this laptop), and even tried the beta ones. It's been a nightmare, I have no idea what's wrong. Other games in fullscreen seem to be just fine? If not slightly more choppyish than normal. Strangely if I"m windowed or borderless windowed, it's fine. I attached the Sys information from the built Hi everyone, have a issue that stared today. Loaded up some Dota 2, crashed right away, so you know whatever these things happen go to re-connect same thing, 3 more times same thing. Load up Starcraft 2, after about 5 minutes game crashes, load up another game of sc2 after 10 minutes the game crashes. So the obvious thing here is games, so I underclocked the card 20% using MSi afterburner ran 3D mark as a test and that crashed as well. However I had CPU Z and Open hardware monitor 
i have a dll error, i did google it, find possible fixes but not of them work for me. i try following things; install directx 9.0, install vc++ 2010, install directx sdk, create system.cfg(c:/archage/documents) file and put recommended content, update my graphic card driver but not of them work for me. my os: windows 8.1 my graphic card: 1gb nvidia geforce gt 320m my ram: 4gb ram please help me, thanks. When I try to include d3dx9.h, it says fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'd3dx9.h': No such file or directory when I attempt to compile it. I have tried adding the "(DXSDK_DIR)\Include" path to the program properties' include list, but to no avail. DirectX sdk is set up completely, and I have no idea what is causing the problem and how I can make VC++2010 find the header file. Help would be greatly appreciated because I just want to make games dammit. DirectX (от англ. direct — прямой, непосредственный, произносится как ДайректЭкс ) — это набор.
